I want to do something and enjoy it that momment when you create a new successfully software.
At least one user wanna use it hihi. I manually set a small goal for myself. To make a chrome extension in a week. 
That extension will be use for check unfriend status which automatically send notification when someone in my list friend unfriend me..
Sound like poor man. Deadline is 22/08/2016. Chazo
